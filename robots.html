            <h1>The Project</h1>

            <p>The goal of this project is to build a team of humanoid robots able to compete and win the RoboCup World Cup, that will be held in joao Pessoa this year.</p>
            
            <p>Our group has a long tradition in Robotic Soccer. The first time we took part in a competition was in 1998: Prof. Reinaldo Bianchi was a member of the group that developed the FutePOLI Team, which competed in the First Brazilian Micro Robot Soccer Cup, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The same team, renamed as Guaran√°, was the Vice-Champion in the 1998 FIRA Micro Robot World Cup Soccer Tournament (MIROSOT), a competition held in Paris, together with RoboCup'98.</p>

            <p>In the same year, Prof. Reinaldo Bianchi started the development of soccer playing robots at the Centro Universitario da FEI. The first team developed at FEI competed in the Very Small Size Category of the IEEE Robotic Competition, becoming vice-champion in 2003. In 2004, during the First Brazilian Competition on Intelligent Robots (a competition were the IEEE Robot Competition was held together with the First Brazilian RoboCup), our team became Brazilian Champion in the IEEE Very Small category. In the same competition, our first team developed for the RoboCup Small Size League became vice-champion In 2006, Very Small Size team became Champion again, and our first 2D RoboCup Simulation team was the Brazilian champion.</p>

            <p>The institution RoboCup Small Size League team, called RoboFEI, won for the first time the Brazilian Robocup in 2010, and is currently the Brazilian champion, winning the championship 4 times in a row (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013). This team takes part in the RoboCup World Competition since 2009, and the best result we had was in 2012, when we stayed among the 8 top teams.</p>

            <p>After developing robotic soccer players for the last 15 years, we now developed a team to compete in the RoboCup Humanoid League. The development of this team started in 2012, with students designing and building a humanoid robot from scratch. Now, we have a team that is able to compete in the RoboCup World Cup competition.</p>

            <h2>Research interests</h2>

            <p>Our group consists of 3 Faculty Professors (one from the electrical, one from the mechanical and one from computer science departments) 3 Ph.D., 2 MSc. and 2 undergraduate students. Our current research interests are:</p>
            
            <ul>

            <li>Mechanical design of humanoid robots: how can a robot be build, using lighter parts and new kinematic configurations? In particular, we are studying Topology Optimization as a way to built stronger and lighter parts for the robots.</li>
            
            <li>Gait generation and optimization: how to automatically generate gaits and optimize them? We are using Reinforcement Learning, Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing.</li>

            <li>Stabilization Methods: most researchers use Center of Gravity or Zero Moment Point methods to stabilize the robot. Can Reinforcement Learning be used to prevent the robot from falling down, dynamically?</li>

            <li>Vision: can we build a robust method for finding the ball and other robots? We have studied the use of the Hough Transform, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machines to create a robust vision system.</li>

            <li>Robot Localization: can a qualitative-probabilistic approach be used to address the problem of mobile robot localization? We are investigating the combination of Qualitative Reasoning with a Bayesian filter to localize the robots.</li>

            <li>Multi-Robot Task Allocation: how can we dynamically change the role of the robots during the game? We aim to adapt a system developed for our a RoboCup Small Size League team, where robots participate of auctions for the available roles, such as attacker or defender, and use Reinforcement Learning to evaluate their aptitude to perform these roles, given the situation of the team, in real-time.</li>

            <li>Spacial reasoning in multi robot systems: how to enhance the existing spatial reasoning systems towards collaborative systems in which multiple viewpoints of a scene can be interpreted within a single formalism? We are study a new formalism, which we call Collaborative Spatial Reasoning, that can be applied on the scene interpretation from multiple cameras and on the task of scene understanding from the viewpoints of multiple robots.</li>

            <li>Case Based Reasoning for soccer games: can we use cases, as set-pieces? We have been studying the use of CBR, together with Reinforcement Learning, to have a collection of cases that can work as set-pieces during the game.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As it can be seen, our research interests range from the very bottom level of the robot construction, to the high level intelligent control of the team behavior.</p>
