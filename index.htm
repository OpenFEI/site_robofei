            <h1>History</h1>

            <p>Our group has a long tradition in Robotic Soccer. The first time we took part in a competition was in 1998: Prof. Reinaldo Bianchi was a member of the group that developed the FutePOLI Team, which competed in the First Brazilian Micro Robot Soccer Cup, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The same team, renamed as Guaran√°, was the Vice-Champion in the 1998 FIRA Micro Robot World Cup Soccer Tournament (MIROSOT), a competition held in Paris, together with RoboCup'98.</p>

            <p>In the same year, Prof. Reinaldo Bianchi started the development of soccer playing robots at the Centro Universitario da FEI. The first team developed at FEI competed in the Very Small Size Category of the IEEE Robotic Competition, becoming vice-champion in 2003. In 2004, during the First Brazilian Competition on Intelligent Robots (a competition were the IEEE Robot Competition was held together with the First Brazilian RoboCup), our team became Brazilian Champion in the IEEE Very Small category. In the same competition, our first team developed for the RoboCup Small Size League became vice-champion In 2006, Very Small Size team became Champion again, and our first 2D RoboCup Simulation team was the Brazilian champion.</p>

            <p>The institution RoboCup Small Size League team, called RoboFEI, won for the first time the Brazilian Robocup in 2010, and is currently the Brazilian champion, winning the championship 4 times in a row (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013). This team takes part in the RoboCup World Competition since 2009, and the best result we had was in 2012, when we stayed among the 8 top teams.</p>

            <p>After developing robotic soccer players for the last 15 years, we now developed a team to compete in the RoboCup Humanoid League. The development of this team started in 2012, with students designing and building a humanoid robot from scratch. Now, with soccer robots established on competitions and researches, we are interested also on service and social robots. In that way, we start to develop also a @Home team to compete in Robocup.</p>
